    <!-- Site Introduction -->
    <p class="standard">
      Outside of the world of computing, parallelism is actually an incredibly prevalent topic. It's all about multitasking. Bakeries don't make pastries one by one! They bake
      an entire batch at the same time. Otherwise, they'd never keep up with orders. Likewise, computer hardware is actully designed to do multiple jobs at the same time. Processors are
      built to perform computations in parallel. However, computer architects at the dawn computing's rise made models and wrote languages that were serial. Programmers for decades have
      been trained to see the computer as a machine that executes tasks sequentially (one by one). Too many people are not taught to capitalize on computers' multitasking superpowers.
      Thus, their programs, written serially, stagnate even though computer chips are packed with more cores and transistors every year. Their programs don't scale with the increasing power of
      computer hardware!

    <p class="standard">
      To implement parallelism, the industry has designed various patterns/skeletons that are known best practices. A programmer's job is to study these patterns and to recognize where they may
      fit in a program to parallelize tasks. Therefore, this site is organized into sections that each revolve around a pattern. Each section has a LaTeX-formatted document discussing the pattern's theory.
      The discussion of theory is then followed by several experiments in Python that put the theory to a test.

    <p class="standard">
      The text used to learn how each pattern works was <i>Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation</i> (ISBN-13: 978-0124159938) by Michael McCool, James Reinders, and Arch Robinson. It
      is available as an online resource at the Santa Clara County Library District. However, the book provides implementations in C and C++. Parallelism is particularly powerful in demanding computer vision and machine learning work.
      For such jobs, Python is the industry favorite. Thus, <i>Mastering Concurrency in Python</i> (ISBN-13: 978-1789343052) by Quan Nguyen was used to learn Python's parallelism tools. The experiments following the discussion of
      each pattern's theory are implemented in Python.
